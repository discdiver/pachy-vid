# Pachyderm FAQ

### Using Pachyderm locally with minikube, what do I do if I need to restart? 

`minikube delete`, `minikube start`, `pachctl deploy local`, port forward. See suggested workflow [here]().

### How long does Pachyderm take to to get my k8s pods running?

It can take five minutes or so with minikube, and is generally much faster with Docker Desktop.

### How long does port forwarding take?

If it hasn't completed in a few minutes, try `export ADDRESS=<minikubeIP>:30650`.

### Can I start processing one job before another finishes?

Nope. Jobs get processed one at a time because often times the execution of one job depends on the previous job's result.

### What's the best way to commit large files to Pachyderm from my local machine?

`export ADDRESS=<minikubeIP>:30650` instead of port-forward. 

### What's the best way to commit large files from an S3 bucket?

`put-file repo master -f s3://...` 

### After uploading data to a repo that outputs data via a pipeline to a pipeline repo, the list-repo command show the size of the output repo still at 0B. Does this mean I don't have any data in the output repo?

Not necessarily. This is a bug and a fix is in the works. Use `pachctl list-commit my_output_repo_name` to see if any files were output.

### Can I use Pachyderm locally with a Windows machine?

Yes, see the installation [instructions](http://docs.pachyderm.io/en/stable/getting_started/local_installation.html).

### How can I figure out why my job failed?

Run `pachctl inspect-job my_job_id` and it will give you a `reason` field.

### How can I save pipeline definitions created in a supported Pachyderm language client into a JSON file?

`extract-pipeline`

### For a machine learning workflow, if I want to outpout both transformed data (e.g. images) and hyperparameters learned during training, how should I set that up? 

Output the images and hyperparameters into two different directories in the same output repo. Matching results/configs are stored in the same commit, so the process is easy to reason about. Then have a downstream pipeline use a glob pattern such as `/config/*` to only consume the hyperparameters and not the other output files.

### How should I back up my Pachyderm stuff?

`pachctl extract` It can back up the following, if you include your object store:  objects, tags, repos, input commits, input branches, and pipelines. Any output data is recomputed after `pachctl restore`.  It restores the full commit structure of input repos, but in only restores the head commit of output branches. It doesnâ€™t yet backup the enterprise key or access controls (Jan 2019).  We hope to address that in a future release. 

### How can I delete Pachyderm stuff I don't need?
Choose from the following:
```
delete-repo my_repo
delete-commit my_commit
delete-branch my_branch
delete-file my_file
delete-job my_job
delete-pipeline my_pipeline
delete-all 
```


## Kubernetes-related questions

### What's Kubernetes?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), a.k.a. k8s, orchestrates containers. It's an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### What's kubectl?

[kubctl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) is Kubernetes's command-line tool. If you're using it with Pachyderm you'll mostly use it to inspect cluster resources.

### How should I use Pachyderm locally on a Mac?

We recommend you install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). See the [Pachyderm install docs](https://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/local_installation.html) for more info.

### What's minikube?

Minikube is a tool that runs Kubernetes locally. Minikube creates a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM. It's slower and requires more configuration than Docker Desktop or MicroK8s, so it isn't our recommended solution for using Pachyderm locally.

### Minikube isn't cooperating when I try to start it, what should I do?

minikube v.0.31.0 doesn't work well with virtualbox. Fixes are forthcoming by the Kubernetes team. For now, if using VirtualBox with minikube we recommend you install minikube v0.30.0. Instructions from [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases):

On Mac OsX:

`curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.30.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo cp minikube /usr/local/bin/ && rm minikube`

On Linux:

`curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.30.0/minikube-linux-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo cp minikube /usr/local/bin/ && rm minikube`

### Can I use [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) instead of minikube? 

Pachyderm users have reported successfully deploying Pachyderm with microk8s on Ubuntu machines. On a Mac, it's easier to use Docker Desktop.
