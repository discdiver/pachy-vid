# Pachyderm Example: Videos to images

![Screenshot](images/ss15.png)
      
In this example you'll use Pachyderm to take one or more video files and split them into individual frames using the opencv library. With this example running, getting individual image frames from videos is a piece of cake. 

As part of this example we'll introduce you to some of the Pachyderm dashboard's features. The dashboard is part of the Pachyderm Enterprise Edition. New users receive a two-week free trial of the Pachyderm Enterprise Edition. 

Pachyderm quickly processes multiple videos simultaneously through parallelization. Additionally, when videos are added, the Pachyderm pipeline runs automatically, outputting frames as .jpg files in a folder for each video. After this project you'll have pictures you can put on coffee mugs and calendars for your friends in no time :).

 Let's get started!

## Prerequisites
This example assumes you have Pachyderm running locally. Check out the [Local Installation instructions](https://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/local_installation.html) if you havenâ€™t installed pachyderm. This example has been run with Pachyderm version 1.8.0.

## Step 1: Create a Pachyderm repo

Run `pachctl create-repo videos` to create your *videos* input repo.

Then run `pachctl list-repo` to verify your repo was created.

Alternatively, you can create your repo in the Pachyderm dashboard in your browser at *localhost:300080* by 
clicking on the *+* icon in the bottom right of the page. 

Then click on *Create Repo*.

Then type *videos* in the *Repo name* field and click *save*.

Viola! You've got a repo.

## Step 2: Create a Pachyderm pipeline

Pipelines are specified in a JSON file. For this example, we've created a pipeline for you. The Pachyderm pipeline spec docs are [here](http://docs.pachyderm.io/en/latest/reference/pipeline_spec.html). 

We're going to create a single pipeline that takes one or more videos and outputs up to the first 1,000 frames of each video as .jpg images. 

When a pipeline is created, Pachyderm runs your code on the data in your input repo. In this case, your data is your videos. The pipeline runs again to process new videos each time they are added to your input repo. 

The first time Pachyderm runs a pipeline, it downloads the Docker image specified in the pipeline spec from the specified Docker registry (Docker Hub in this case - the default). This first download might take a few minutes, depending on your internet speed. Subsequent runs with the same image should be faster.

Pachyderm will automatically create your output pipeline and output repository based on your JSON pipeline spec. Run the following code to create the pipeline.

`pachctl create-pipeline -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discdiver/pachy-vid/master/frames.json`

If you have the Pachyderm dashboard open, you'll see magic happen when you create your pipeline from the command line. The *images_pipeline* connects the *videos* input repo to the  *images_pipeline* output repo.

Below is the pipeline spec and Python code we're using. Let's walk through the details.

# frames.json
```
{
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "images_pipeline"
  },
  "input": {
    "atom": {
      "glob": "/*",
      "repo": "videos"
    }
  },
  "transform": {
    "cmd": [
      "python",
      "./frames.py",
      "/pfs/videos",
      "/pfs/out",
      "1000"
     ],
    "image": "discdiver/frames:v1.43"
  },
  "parallelism_spec": {
    "constant": 2
  },
  "enable_stats": true
}
```

This Pachyderm pipeline spec contains five sections. First is the pipeline name, *frames*. This name becomes the name of your pipeline output repo.

Second is the input. Here we have one "atom" input: the *frames* repo name with a '/*' glob pattern. The glob pattern defines how the input data can be broken up for parallel processing. `/*` means that each top level file can be processed individually, assuming you have enough workers available. Glob patterns are a powerful Pachyderm feature. 

Third is the transform that specifies the Docker image to use, *discdiver/frames:v1.40* (defaults to Docker Hub for the registry). The transform also specifies the entrypoint script *frames.py*. 

Fourth is the *parallelism_spec* that determines how many workers the pipeline uses.

The final part of the pipeline spec is *enable_stats:true*, which allows you to see useful information about the pipeline when a job runs.

If you are using the Pachyderm dashboard, you can expand the bottom right menu and create a Pipeline from a form or by copying your JSON code.

![Screenshot](images/ss19.png)

The pipeline specifies that the *frames.py* Python script will run when a commit is made. A commit is made and *frames.py* is run when the pipeline is made for the first time, when data is added to the input repo, or when a pipeline is updated and Pachyderm is told the underlying code changed. 

Your Dockerfile tells Docker to package *frames.py* as part of the Docker image. 

The `frames.py` code is below. 

```
# frames.py
# code for video to image frames pachyderm example

import os
import cv2
import numpy as np
import argparse

# command line arguments
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Get params for video to images')
parser.add_argument('indir', type=str, help='Input directory containing videos')
parser.add_argument('outdir', type=str, help='Output directory for images')
parser.add_argument('max_images', type=int, help='Max frames to output per video')
args = parser.parse_args()

def make_images(video, outdir="/pfs/out", max_images=1000):
    '''

    Args:
        video (str):                          File name of video
        outdir="/pfs/images_pipeline" (str):  Output directory
        max_images=1000 (int):                Max frames to output per video
    Returns:
        none
    '''

    file_name_w_ext = os.path.split(video)[1]
    print(file_name_w_ext)
    file_name = file_name_w_ext[:file_name_w_ext.rfind('.')]
    print(file_name)

    vidcap = cv2.VideoCapture(video)
    vid_length = int(vidcap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT))

    count = 0                                 # counter to stay under max images
    output_dir = f"{outdir}/{file_name}"

    if not os.path.isdir(output_dir):
        os.mkdir(output_dir)                  # cv2 requires directory to exist

    while count < max_images and count < vid_length:
        try:
            success, image = vidcap.read()
            cv2.imwrite(
                os.path.join(
                    output_dir, file_name + "frame{:d}.jpg".format(count)),
                    image
                )
        except Exception as e:
            print("Oops, there was an exception: {}".format(e))

        count += 1

ok_file_type = {'mp4', '3gp', 'flv', 'mkv', 'mov', 'webm', 'vob', 'ogv', 'ogg',
                'gif', 'gifv', 'mng', 'avi', 'mts', 'm2ts', 'qt', 'wmv', 'yuv',
                'rm', 'rmvb', 'asf', 'm4p', 'm4v', 'mpg', 'mp2', 'mpeg', 'mpe',
                'mpv', 'm2v', 'm4v', '.svi', '3gp', '.3g2', '.mxf', 'roq',
                '.nsv','f4v', 'f4p', 'f4a', 'f4b'}

# walk indir and call make_images on each file if file type in ok_file_type
for dirpath, dirs, files in os.walk(args.indir):
    for file in files:
        if (file[-3:].lower() in ok_file_type or
            file[-4:].lower() in ok_file_type or
            file[-2:].lower() in ok_file_type):

            make_images(os.path.join(dirpath, file), args.outdir, args.max_images)
```

*/pfs/images_pipeline* and */pfs/out* are local directories that Pachyderm creates for you. All the input data for a pipeline will be found in */pfs/input_repo_name*, where *input_repo_name* is specified in your Pachyderm .json specification file. 

Your app should always write output to */pfs/out* or a subdirectory you create inside */pfs/out*. Pachyderm will automatically gather everything written to */pfs/out* and version it in a pipeline's output commit.

## Step 3: Put data into Pachyderm
From the command line use `put-file` along with the `-f` flag to denote a local file, a URL, or an object storage bucket (e.g. s3). In the current project, if you have the current repo cloned you can just upload a video file from the project folder. Alternatively, you can upload your own video file of type .mp4, .flv, mkv, or 3gp. 

Also specify the repo name, *videos*, the branch name, *master*, a name for the video file, (e.g. *buck_bunny.mp4*), and the path to the file, (e.g. *https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discdiver/pachy-vid/master/sample_vids/vid1.mp4*).

``` pachctl put-file videos master buck_bunny.mp4 -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discdiver/pachy-vid/master/sample_vids/vid1.mp4 ```

When you add a new file to Pachyderm it automatically runs your pipeline and makes a commit of your data. 

## Step 4: View the commit 
See the commit with `pachctl list-commit videos` and see the files committed with `pachctl list-file videos master`.

In the Pachyderm dashboard you can see the details of the commit. You can also interactively visualize your pipeline and drill down into your jobs, datums, and processed and unprocessed files.

Data lineage, or provenance, is a core feature of Pachyderm. The dashboard makes it easy to see every step in the processes that produced each result.

## Step 5: View your beautiful images
See an individual image frame by getting it from your Pachyderm repo and viewing with this command on a Mac:
```
$ pachctl get-file images_pipeline master buck_bunny/buck_bunnyframe100.jpg | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app
```

Alternatively, in the Pachyderm dashboard, you can navigate to the output files from your commit and preview and download your images.

There's lots to checkout in the Pachyderm dashboard, so have a look around!

## Step 6: Keep building!
You've seen just how easy it is to set up a Pachyderm pipeline that takes in video files and outputs image files. You've also had a quick look at the Pachyderm dashboard. Now you can go forth and make image slices from your favorite home videos to put on holiday cards, bibs, or banners.
